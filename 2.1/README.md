# Second course first semester labs
This package will consist second course first semester university labs.
There are 4 labs and every one uses a specific library to interract with
very big digits that all kryptography is based around.
First lab is written with mmath32.lib and the rest with miracl.lib.
Documentation to the both of them you can find in this package, or use the direct link
on [**mmath library**](https://github.com/YaDaniil/NURE-labs/blob/master/2.1/Mmath_descr.doc) and 
on [**miracle library**](https://github.com/YaDaniil/NURE-labs/blob/master/2.1/manual.doc)

Labs:

1. Implementation RSA encrypting with generating prime digits P and Q using Leman and Div tests.(mmath.lib)

2. Implementation PowMod function t—â raise to a power modulo and test this one.(miracl.lib)

3. Implementation ElGamal digital signature.(miracl.lib)

4. Implementation timing runtime of powmod2(Shamir method) and others routines and their comparison.(miracl.lib)
